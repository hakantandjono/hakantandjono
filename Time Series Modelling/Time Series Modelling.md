We can employ time series forecasting models to predict future outcomes. This involves transforming data into a stationary form and then valuing future data as stochastic parameters, which also rely on past trends. In this folder, I have included a volatility prediction model for AAPL and a time series model for US CPI. These models serve as valuable tools for anticipating future trends and making informed decisions in financial and economic contexts.
