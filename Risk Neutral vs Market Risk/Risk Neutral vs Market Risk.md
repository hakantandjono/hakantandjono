Most often, market dynamics suggest a log-normal future price or a distribution resembling normality in returns. By leveraging Girsanov's Theorem, I illustrate the capability to derive equivalent risk-neutral parameters through the conversion of market risk data. This insight is particularly valuable in the pricing of derivatives, as replication dictates that derivative prices must be rendered risk-neutral to eliminate arbitrage possibilities.
