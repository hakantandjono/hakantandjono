I have developed a portfolio optimization program based on the efficient market hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, returns are correlated with risk. Therefore, one can optimize portfolio weights by blending stocks into a basket and adjusting their risk preferences accordingly. The implication is that stock returns are not purely technical but are influenced by a combination of economic and business conditions.
