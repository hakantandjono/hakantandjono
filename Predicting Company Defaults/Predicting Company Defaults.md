In this study, I predicted the default event of First Energy Corp. in 2018 using two main approaches. Firstly, the cross-sectional approach (Altman LDA and Ohlson Logit Model) utilized balance sheet data to assess the probability of default. Secondly, the stochastic approach (Merton Model) treated equity as stochastic and calculated the probability of default under a normal distribution, where the value of the company would potentially fall below its debt.
